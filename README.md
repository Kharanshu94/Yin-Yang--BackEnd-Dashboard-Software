# Yin-Yang--BackEnd-Dashboard-Software
.NET based software is use for fetching real-time data from the system of 1.2GW manufacturing Facility

HALM- A Germany based company making hardware and software to measure electrical performance of the solar cell in terms of voltage, current, power etc.

</> Two software(YIN & YANG) were conceptualized to extract and visualize real-time data from HALM computers. 

</> Primary Aim of the software(YIN) installed at HALM PC is to process data from Microsoft Data Base(.mdb) File and provide output string to the software(YANG) installed at remote location.

</> Software(YIN) at HALM PC works as Data Extractor and other software(YANG) at remote location functions as Data Visualizer.

</> Both software are designed to work in tandem. One is useless without other.

</> YIN and YANG software names are inspired from very famous Chinese philosophy which tells about the importance of harmony and coexistence.
